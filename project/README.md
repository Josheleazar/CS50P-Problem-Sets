# Capitalization Rate Calculator

#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/V50gTXVxpJc>

#### Description:

The program prompts the user the expected number of units in a rental property, the monthly rent attached to

each, and the expected purchase cost, then outputs the Capitalization Rate using the given information.

#### Units

This refers tho the number of rental units available inside the property.

The program assumes all factors remain constant i.e the building has a 100% vacancy rate which means all the

units are occupied with paying clients throughout every month of the year

#### Rent

This is the fee all tenants are to pay every month to reside within the premises.

#### Yearly Revenue

The product of rent and the number of units in the building every month gives the programm the estimated

revenue for the given year. It does account for maintenance costs, staff salaries, property taxes and any other

incurred operational expenses, therefore it's considered be net operating income.

##### Capitalization Rate

A cap rate is the rate of return on a real estate investment property based on the income the property is

expected to generate usually with a period of one year.

It's obtained by multiplying the quotient of net operating and the current market value of an asset by 100%.

#### project.py

This file contains the main implementation of the program which includes a main function and three others

wherein all prompts for user input are executed within the main function so that their return values can be

assigned to variables that are then used as positional arguments shorlty after.


#### test_project.py

This file contains all the unit tests done on all functions in the project file except main.
